Vesperas history is a scam

Like most companies ,Vespera started small. Originally manufacturers of low grade technological devices such as personal communicators and data storage units, vespera lived out its first few decades being relatively unnoticed and providing cheap, uninspired tech to anyone who would buy. Their founder, however, sought more, and as time went on he developed an obsession for a vehicle manufacturer named Palus. He studied their history, products and methods of operation before ultimately deciding he wanted to produce vehicles himself. 

Using the now decently established Vespera production facilities, he instructed his staff to design a few tester vehicles that he could display to prospective new buyers and hopefully start a new empire. this failed spectacularly with the only vehicle to be produced being a cheap unreliable hoverbike, named the "wasp", plunging  vespera into a crisis. As a last resort, the founder went the way of espionage, hiring a team of 4 Fixers (just like you) to steal all of Palus's data and then wipe their servers. essentially hijacking their new projects. while successful, it was clear that vespera had no means to actually produce these larger scale vehicles. Instead, they chose to sell the Data and used the proceeds to fund a series of similar elaborate thefts that became known as *the wipe*, where several corps went under due to all their work suddenly disappearing. With the titanic amount of money vespera had accrued, they began purchasing the now struggling companies they had just ruined, and absorbed them all under Vesperas name. they now had the know-how, capability and personnel to produce whatever kind of vehicles they wanted.

For 2000 years, Vespera produced many lines of vehicles other corporations had designed and marketed them as their own, ever so slightly tweaking them with each generation to all be closer to a single design standard, Vesperas own brand. Eventually, Vespera began producing armoured vehicles which drew the attention of Ardeck, who proposed a new project, an array of weaponized vehicles. 

While the Founder is long dead, (having been ironically killed by a faulty prototype) their illegal and dirty tactics have remained, with manipulation and corporate sabotage running rampant. They were heavily involved in the creation of the RSF and have supplied hundreds of terrorists and warlords with their cutting edge tech. Their new Head, a young Arcadian Fox named Ayre, spearheads Vespera into the future, with a brilliant team of scientists and engineers creating new cutting edge aircraft and armoured ground vehicles.

Vespera's history is a scam, and may be the greatest lie *ever* told![[Screenshot_20241014_235801_com_openai_chatgpt_MainActivity.jpg]]
