*Description*:  
The Kinetic Shotgun is a brutal and efficient close-range weapon designed for maximum stopping power. Each shell contains a condensed slug of kinetic energy that, upon impact, delivers a devastating force capable of tearing through armour and sending enemies sprawling. Its unique recoil-dampening mechanism ensures steady aim, but the raw power can still kick like a mule. Perfect for clearing hallways and securing rooms, though less effective at longer ranges.
