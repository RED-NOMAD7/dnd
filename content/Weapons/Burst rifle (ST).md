Description:
The TRX-9 Burst Rifle is designed for tactical precision and controlled fire. Utilizing a 3-round burst system, this weapon maximizes the balance between accuracy and firepower, ideal for engaging multiple targets or controlling mid-range combat zones. The rifle’s advanced targeting assist compensates for recoil, allowing the operator to maintain consistent fire on target with minimal spread, making it devastating in the hands of a trained marksman.
Firing high-velocity kinetic rounds, each burst delivers concentrated damage capable of punching through light to medium armor with ease. The TRX-9 is modular, with options for under-barrel attachments like grenade launchers, laser pointers, or even advanced smart-scope systems that sync with a HUD.
Special: On a successful hit, the TRX-9 can force an enemy to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 13). On a failure, the target becomes disoriented, reducing their movement speed by half until the start of their next turn. The rifle’s burst mode also grants advantage on attack rolls when firing at the same target consecutively.
