Description:
The Plasma Pulse Pistol is a lightweight, versatile sidearm favored by operatives in both urban combat and space-faring missions. Firing bursts of superheated plasma, the pistol excels in accuracy and speed. Its energy cells are highly efficient, allowing for sustained use in prolonged engagements. While not as powerful as larger weapons, its portability and precision make it a reliable backup in close-quarters or when a primary weapon isn't practical.
The weapon's sleek design includes a rapid-recharge function, allowing it to replenish spent energy cells from ambient sources (1 charge per round while not in use). The plasma rounds are highly effective against organic targets, causing intense heat damage and burning wounds.
