Real name Ceres Ashgrove, The Ward is the youngest of the RSF commanders, and also their least experienced. She joined the prestigious Templar fleet which specialized in stopping attacks from enemies like the convergence and the Nullserpents. She believed fighting against tyrannical monstrosities was the RSF's whole MO, and enjoyed her work so much that she pulled off regularly pulled off extreme feats of bravery in order to save her comrades from certain death. She became known as many things, protector, guardian angel, goddess and so much more. The curator, one of the highest ranking RSF members and the one responsible for selecting new commanders immediately became aware of Ceres' actions and propelled her budding career to new heights. She was deployed on a high priority mission along with the Maul, the Peregrine and a *massive* suppression fleet to "save an alien race from civil war" (in reality it was to secure a large titanium reserve for Alus robotics, one of the "big 5"),  to a world belonging to peaceful aliens known as the Urgakoz. The RSF was greeted with celebrations and gifts from the aliens, as they had never received interstellar visitors before, but the RSF quickly turned their backs on them. It only took 3 hours for the RSF to start pillaging the land and forcing the Urgakoz from their homes. When Ceres questioned the high commands orders, they lied to her and said the aliens were being humanely relocated to safer environments and were treated respectfully. The RSF pushed the Urgakoz to near extinction at Alus' request, and The Ward was manipulated by them into believing the aliens needed to be brought in line to protect themselves. To this day she still has doubts about those orders

Her faith in the RSF is waning, I wonder what would happen if she was shown the atrocities *she* unknowingly helped commit first-hand![[DALLÂ·E 2024-10-19 23.36.26 - A full-body image of a young woman RSF commander with smooth flowing blonde hair that falls past her shoulders, wearing sleek black angular RSF armor.webp]]
