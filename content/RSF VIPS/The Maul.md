- **Cybernetic Resilience**: The Maul can use his reaction to halve any damage taken from an attack, three times per fight


The Maul is one of the RSF's most valued assets, and by far one of their deadliest. He Stands at a titanic 8ft, is heavily armoured and wields a giant energy hammer, known as *nightfall*, which leaves plasma scars on everything it touches. The Maul is human but *heavily* imbued with technology produced by Alus's medical division. this tech is rumoured to be the only thing keeping him alive, after he was heavily wounded in a battle with Neptune, one of the Convergences nine *god machines.* This battle left him so injured that 90% of his biomass had to be replaced with the metallic body he now inhabits, ironic, given his unmatched hatred for the Convergence and their *false metal flesh*. He is a harbinger of the RSF's control and a painful reminder of their strength. Should you face him, steel yourself, for he is the living embodiment of their mantra, 

*no mercy*
