The Peregrine is an unusual commander for the RSF as she does not fight in person. She is a pilot, and a terrifying one at that. Born on Arcadia, she has experienced conflict her whole life, and it shaped her into what she is. She joined New Exergis (the new arcadian revolution after Exergisian tide was torn to shreds with the rest of arcadia by the RSF 200 years ago) at an extremely young age with the goal of becoming a legendary pilot and dominating the skies. This did not take long as she proved to be adept with the Zephyr, New Exergis' main combat aircraft, quickly racking up stacks of loyalist kills and climbing the ranks. Until strangely one day, she just stopped. disillusioned with the current day arcadia and its never ending war, she decided to seek out the ones who caused it, the CRT, Unaware of a key part of its history. in space she encountered the RSF, who engaged her immediately with several fighters. Not a single one survived. they detained her with a much larger modified Helianthus and offered her a choice, "join us or be jettisoned into space". She accepted and quickly became one of their top fighters, slowly growing into her role and coming to appreciate their control, in a twisted case of stockholm syndrome. she had become one of their most devoted pilots, attracting the eye of Vespera and becoming the head of its new CAS project, Maranta.V2. She will ensure the skies are darkened wherever the RSF wants them to be, and like a bird of prey, will never let her target escape.
