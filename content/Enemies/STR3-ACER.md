The Acer is an old generation combat strider still in use by the RSF today (if it isn't broke don't fix it) developed by Vespera with assistance from Alus robotics, its a tried and tested design that provides an equal amount of combat and traversal prowess. while rumours have circulated that new mech designs are underway due to increasingly dangerous and complex conflicts (such as the wars on  arcadia and endara), there is no telling when these will appear, nor how effective they will be. it is outfitted with twin energy blasters on each side of its hull, and smaller grenade launchers for AOE effect and cover dispersal. taking down an acer is not the hardest task but not exactly the easiest either, quick thinking will overwhelm it, but failure to recognize its patterns could prove to be your end.
