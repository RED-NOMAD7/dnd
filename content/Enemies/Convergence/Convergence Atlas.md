### Description:

The **Convergence Atlas** stands as the ultimate symbol of brute force and impenetrable defence within the Convergence. Towering over most units at nearly 9 feet, it moves slowly but with undeniable power. Its white segmented armour is heavily reinforced with black struts, designed to withstand the most devastating of attacks. Pulsing red lights run along the seams of its plating, indicating the immense energy contained within its frame.

Unlike its lighter counterparts, the Atlas is built for direct confrontation. Equipped with a massive plasma cannon integrated into one arm and a reinforced hammer-like limb for melee combat, it can obliterate both infantry and armoured vehicles alike. Its angular head, with the iconic red visor strip, radiates cold focus as it locks onto targets with deadly precision.

Though its mobility is limited, the Atlas excels in defensive operations, able to stand its ground in the heat of battle. In Bulwark Mode, its plating hardens further, turning it into an unbreakable wall that allows its allies to regroup or press the offensive. To face a Convergence Atlas is to stare down a relentless engine of war, designed for one purpose: the destruction of all obstacles in the path of the Convergence’s higher function![[DALL·E 2024-10-14 22.45.52 - A futuristic alien robot soldier, representing a heavy infantry unit called the Convergence Juggernaut.
