### Description:

The **Convergence obelisk** is a towering war machine, rolling forward with unstoppable force. Designed for heavy combat, its body is a hulking mass of fortified white segmented armor, with black reinforcements and glowing red lights tracing the seams. Two massive plasma cannons sit atop its frame, capable of delivering devastating firepower at long range.

Its angular head, sporting the characteristic red visor strip, scans the battlefield with machine-like precision. Beneath its sturdy shell, roller treads grind the ground as it advances, able to crush anything in its path. The Obelisk is both a weapon and a shield, equipped to deliver massive destruction while also withstanding enemy fire.

Built to support Convergence ground forces, the Obelisk is deployed when absolute dominance is required on the battlefield. Its powerful energy blast can level fortifications, while its fortified mode allows it to serve as an immovable bulwark, protecting other Convergence units as they advance.![[DALLÂ·E 2024-10-15 23.00.28 - A futuristic alien robot tank, representing the Convergence Vanguard unit.
