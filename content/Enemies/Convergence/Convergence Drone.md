### Description:

Standing at 6 feet tall, the Convergence Grunt moves with mechanical precision. Its segmented white armour gleams under the light, while sleek red lights pulse rhythmically along its limbs and torso. Black accents serve as structural supports, providing a menacing contrast to the clean, futuristic lines of its design. The angular head turns with unnerving accuracy, scanning for threats with cold efficiency.

Each Grunt is a piece of a larger machine—every motion, every attack, perfectly synchronized to serve the Convergence's grand purpose. Though they lack the advanced intellect of their higher-ranking counterparts, these soldiers are relentless in combat, showing no fear or hesitation. To them, death is a mere malfunction to be corrected in the eyes of their 9 overseers.![[DALL·E 2024-10-13 21.39.09 - A futuristic alien robot soldier, representing a rank-and-file grunt of the Convergence faction.
