_Description_:  
Infantry engagements with heavily melee focused races such as the jiralhanae showed the RSF that sometimes keeping your distance is key to success, after all, nothing is more effective against someone with a sword than a railgun slug travelling at 600mph from 5 metres away...

Armed with a state-of-the-art Precision Rail Sniper Rifle, the sniper can take out targets from extreme distances with deadly accuracy, using thermal optics to detect hidden or camouflaged enemies. The plasma dagger offers a silent, energy-infused blade for close-quarters combat or last-resort scenarios.
