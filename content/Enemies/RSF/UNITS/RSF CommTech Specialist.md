_Description_:  
The CommTech Specialist plays a vital role in RSF suppression teams, ensuring that troops remain connected, informed, and coordinated on the battlefield. Outfitted in medium armour integrated with advanced communication systems, this specialist can relay real-time tactical data, intercept enemy signals, and coordinate strike teams with precision. The armor features sleek metallic plating, with glowing data lines indicating the active comm systems, while the helmet’s visor projects a holographic display for battlefield intel.

Equipped with a compact energy rifle for personal defense, the CommTech Specialist is more than capable of holding their own in a fight. However, their true strength lies in their ability to keep the squad operating as a seamless unit. Using their signal disruptor, they can disable enemy electronics, jamming communications and rendering devices useless during critical moments of combat.![[DALL·E 2024-10-11 21.41.09 - A futuristic combat comms specialist designed for a sci-fi themed campaign.
