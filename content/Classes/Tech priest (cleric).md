### **Tech-Priest Features**:

**Nanotech Infusion (Replaces Divine Spellcasting)**:  
The Tech-Priest uses **Nanotech Infusion** instead of divine spells, relying on advanced medical nanobots and energy manipulation to perform miraculous feats of healing and protection. These nanobots flow through the Tech-Priest’s body and can be deployed to heal, create protective barriers, or even disrupt enemy systems.

- **Nanite Healing** (Replaces Healing Word/Cure Wounds): The Tech-Priest releases a swarm of nanobots that heal an ally’s wounds, regenerating hit points over time or instantly.
- **Energy Barrier** (Replaces Shield of Faith): The Tech-Priest deploys an energy field around an ally, boosting their AC and providing temporary protection from energy-based attacks.
- **Disruptive Pulse** (Replaces Guiding Bolt): The Tech-Priest fires a pulse of energy that disrupts the enemy’s systems, dealing damage and reducing their ability to resist future attacks.

   - *Life Support Drones*: The Tech-Priest can deploy drones that follow an ally, healing them continuously or reviving them if they fall in battle.

   The **Order of the Vanguard** focuses on protection and defense, using advanced shielding technology and energy manipulation to defend their allies and control the battlefield.

   - *Energy Shield Generator*: The Tech-Priest can create a large, temporary energy shield that covers an area, protecting everyone inside from incoming attacks.
   - *Energy Redirect*: The Tech-Priest can absorb and redirect incoming energy attacks, reflecting damage back at enemies or powering up their own abilities.

   Tech-Priests of the **Order of the Engineer** specialize in technology and AI, able to build and control machines, drones, and automated defenses.

   - *Construct Healing Drone*: The Tech-Priest can build an autonomous healing drone that assists in battle, restoring hit points to nearby allies.
