### **Biomechanic (Druid Replacement)**

**Role**: The Biomechanic is a master of manipulating organic matter and ecosystems, blending nature with advanced technology. They control terraforming processes, biotechnology, and cybernetic organisms, shaping the battlefield and their surroundings. Their powers are derived from an understanding of both nature and machines, using bioengineered plants, creatures, and environmental systems to heal, defend, and attack.

---

### **Key Attributes**:

- *Wisdom* (primary): For controlling the environment, bio-organisms, and their terraforming abilities.
- *Intelligence* (secondary): Useful for understanding advanced technology and interacting with cybernetic organisms.
- *Constitution*: Important for surviving harsh conditions and withstanding attacks while manipulating environments.

### **Biomechanic Features**:

**Terraforming (Replaces Wild Shape)**:  
Instead of transforming into animals, the Biomechanic can **terraform** the environment, reshaping the battlefield with advanced biotech. This allows them to create barriers, enhance terrain, or grow bio-organic constructs to support their allies or hinder their enemies.

- **Terraform Minor**: The Biomechanic can manipulate small areas of terrain, creating cover, bio-bridges, or healing plants that regenerate health over time.
- **Terraform Major**: At higher levels, they can reshape large areas, creating impassable walls, hazardous terrain, or large organic structures that provide healing or offensive capabilities.

---

**Bio-Summons (Replaces Druid’s Animal Forms)**:  
The Biomechanic summons bioengineered creatures—cybernetic animals, plant-based beasts, or genetically modified organisms to fight alongside them. These creatures can be adapted for offense, defense, or support, depending on the situation.

- **Summon Bio-Beast**: Summons a bioengineered creature that deals physical damage and can tear through enemy defenses.
- **Summon Drone-Swarm**: Calls forth a swarm of flying bio-drones that confuse and overwhelm enemies, giving the Biomechanic and their allies an advantage.

### **Biomechanical Techniques (Replaces Druidic Spells)**:

The Biomechanic uses biotech-based abilities to heal, manipulate environments, or control biological systems. These techniques are functionally similar to spells but are presented as biotech tools or devices the Biomechanic can command.

- **Heal via Biotech** (Replaces Cure Wounds): The Biomechanic uses nanobots or regenerative flora to restore health to an ally.
- **Viral Overgrowth** (Replaces Entangle): Causes the ground to burst with cyber-organic vines that trap and damage enemies.
- **Bio-Shield** (Replaces Barkskin): Covers the Biomechanic or an ally in tough bio-organic plating, increasing their armor class.
- **Cyber-Nature Surge** (Replaces Call Lightning): The Biomechanic unleashes a surge of bio-energy, striking multiple enemies with powerful, concentrated energy bursts.

### **Ecological Specializations (Replaces Druid Circles)**:

At level 3, the Biomechanic chooses an **Ecological Specialization**, which enhances their manipulation of different environments and ecosystems.

1. **Specialization: Flora Master**  
   The Flora Master is an expert in controlling and augmenting plant life, able to grow bio-organic structures at will.

   - *Overgrowth*: The Biomechanic causes an area of dense plant growth, creating cover, traps, or healing fields for allies.
   - *Photosynthetic Healing*: Allies standing in bio-augmented fields heal at the start of their turns as the plants provide regenerative energy.

2. **Specialization: Cybernetic Beast Master**  
   The Cybernetic Beast Master focuses on summoning and controlling bio-mechanical creatures to assist in combat.

   - *Advanced Summons*: The Biomechanic can summon powerful cybernetic creatures, such as massive bio-engineered beasts or heavily armored cyber-wolves.
   - *Adaptive Companion*: The summoned bio-creature can adapt to different roles—defensive tank, healer, or offensive striker—depending on the needs of the battle.

3. **Specialization: Terraformer**  
   The Terraformer specializes in reshaping entire environments, manipulating ecosystems, and transforming terrains on a large scale.

   - *Terraformer’s Domain*: The Biomechanic can turn any area into a controlled environment, reshaping the battlefield to create a massive advantage for allies (slowing enemies, providing cover, or setting traps).
   - *Environmental Immunity*: The Biomechanic and their allies gain resistance to damage from natural hazards (acid, radiation, extreme heat, etc.) within terraformed zones.

### **Biological Mastery (Replaces Wild Shape Enhancements)**:  
As the Biomechanic levels up, their control over bio-organic matter and ecosystems increases, allowing them to manipulate larger areas and summon stronger creatures.

- **Bio-Enhancement**: The Biomechanic can bio-augment themselves or an ally, granting them increased physical abilities, such as strength, speed, or heightened senses.
- **Symbiotic Regeneration**: Once per short rest, the Biomechanic can activate a symbiotic regenerative process, healing themselves or an ally over time.

---

### **Ultimate Terraforming (Level 20 Ability)**:  
At their highest level, the Biomechanic gains the ability to **reshape entire landscapes**, completely altering the battlefield or a large region to suit their needs.

- **Bio-Dominion**: Once per long rest, the Biomechanic can terraform a vast area, creating an impenetrable forest, summoning massive bio-organic constructs, or setting up an ecosystem that constantly heals allies and damages enemies over time.

### **Biomechanic Tactics**:
The Biomechanic is a master of adapting the environment, summoning bio-engineered creatures, and using biotechnology to control the battlefield. They excel in controlling the flow of combat, healing allies with regenerative flora, or damaging enemies with bio-organic weapons. Whether protecting their team with environmental shields or overwhelming enemies with cyber-beasts, the Biomechanic is a versatile and formidable force.
