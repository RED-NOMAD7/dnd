### **Warlord (Fighter Replacement)**

**Role**: The Warlord is a battle-hardened warrior, forged in the fires of endless combat. With a focus on pure fighting skill, relentless offense, and brutal efficiency, the Warlord dominates the battlefield through sheer might, tactical precision, and unmatched endurance.

---

### **Key Attributes**:

- *Strength* and *Constitution* are primary for raw physical power and durability.
- *Dexterity* is secondary for those who rely on agility in battle.

---

### **Core Class Features**:

**Battle Surge (Replaces Action Surge)**:  
Once per short rest, the Warlord can push themselves beyond their limits. They unleash a powerful surge of energy, granting them an additional action on their turn. Unlike a standard Action Surge, the Warlord’s surge is infused with raw force, dealing bonus damage on their attacks during this turn (additional 2d6 damage on melee attacks).

---

**Combat Styles**:
The Warlord masters a **Combat Style** early on, each one emphasizing their brutal fighting tactics:

1. **Brutal Brawler**: Focuses on overpowering enemies in close-quarters combat, specializing in unarmed combat, grappling, and wielding heavy melee weapons with devastating effect.
   
2. **Weaponmaster**: Excels with a wide variety of weapons, able to adapt to any situation and use specialized weapon techniques to take down foes.

3. **Juggernaut**: Becomes nearly unstoppable in battle, shrugging off damage and breaking through enemy lines with sheer force.

---

### **Combat Techniques (Replaces Tactical Enhancements)**:
At certain levels, the Warlord gains **Combat Techniques**, brutal maneuvers that enhance their fighting ability. These techniques are used to overpower foes, manipulate the battlefield, or enhance their fighting prowess.

**Examples**:
- **Crushing Blow**: The Warlord delivers a powerful strike that deals an additional 3d6 damage and knocks an enemy prone if they fail a Strength saving throw.
- **Battle Frenzy**: Once per short rest, the Warlord can enter a frenzy, making an additional attack as part of their attack action.
- **Savage Grapple**: The Warlord can initiate a grapple, dealing damage equal to their Strength modifier while holding the enemy in place.
- **Relentless Assault**: The Warlord can make an opportunity attack against any enemy that leaves their melee range, even if they’ve already used their reaction.

---

### **Endurance and Durability**:

**Iron Will (Replaces Second Wind)**:  
Once per short rest, the Warlord can use their inner resolve to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + their Fighter level, but instead of just regaining health, the Warlord also gains temporary hit points equal to half their Fighter level, representing their refusal to fall.

**Unstoppable**:  
At higher levels, the Warlord becomes resistant to physical damage (bludgeoning, piercing, slashing) for a limited duration (1 minute) once per long rest. This gives them immense survivability during critical moments of combat.

---

### **Rage of the Battlefield (Replaces Extra Attack)**:
The Warlord can make a brutal series of attacks when unleashed on the battlefield. They can make an additional attack during their turn, and at higher levels, they can make up to four attacks per turn, emphasizing their relentless combat prowess.

- **Furious Strikes**: When the Warlord hits with a melee weapon, they can add extra damage equal to their Strength modifier to the attack.
- **Brutal Charge**: The Warlord gains advantage on attack rolls made on the first round of combat if they charge into an enemy, dealing additional damage on the first attack.

---

### **Warrior’s Instinct (Replaces Indomitable)**:  
The Warlord develops an instinct for battle, allowing them to avoid deadly strikes and persevere through punishment. When forced to make a saving throw, the Warlord can reroll the result and take the higher roll.

- **Counterstrike**: As a reaction, the Warlord can make a melee attack against an enemy that hits them in melee combat, representing their ability to retaliate immediately.

---

### **Signature Weapon (Replaces Signature Gear)**:
The Warlord becomes one with their weapon, using it to carve through enemy lines with terrifying efficiency. At a certain level, the Warlord can choose a **Signature Weapon**—a brutal melee weapon that becomes an extension of their fighting spirit.

- **Executioner’s Blade**: The Warlord’s chosen weapon deals an additional 1d12 damage on critical hits and cleaves through multiple enemies within range.
- **Savage Gauntlets**: The Warlord’s gauntlets allow them to deliver powerful unarmed strikes, knocking enemies back or grappling them with brutal force.
  
---

### **Relentless Fury (Level 20 Ability)**:
At the pinnacle of their power, the Warlord taps into a **Relentless Fury**, becoming a nearly unstoppable force. They can keep fighting, even after being reduced to 0 hit points, for one minute. During this time, they gain advantage on all attack rolls and deal an additional 2d6 damage on each strike. Once the effect ends, if the Warlord is still at 0 hit points, they immediately fall unconscious.

---

### **Advanced Combat Tactics**:

The Warlord thrives in raw combat situations, where their superior fighting skill and unyielding endurance make them unstoppable. They may rely on brute strength, savage tactics, and relentless offensive assaults to overpower their enemies, making them one of the deadliest forces on the battlefield.
