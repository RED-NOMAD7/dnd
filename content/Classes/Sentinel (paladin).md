### **Sentinel (Paladin Replacement)**

**Role**: A defender of order, justice, or a personal code, wielding advanced tech to protect others and defeat foes. Sentinels are equipped with cutting-edge exosuits, energy shields, and powerful weaponry, making them formidable warriors on the battlefield.

---

### **Attributes**:

- _Strength_ and _Constitution_ are primary for physical prowess.
- _Charisma_ represents their leadership and ability to inspire others with their personal creed or code.

### **Core Tenets**:

The Sentinels are a group of warriors who revolve around protection, justice, or the destruction of specific threats.

---

### **Tech Creed (Oaths)**:

 The Sentinel follows a creed or directive, guiding their actions. These "Tech Creeds" are similar to the Paladin’s oaths, shaping their abilities and powers.

1. **Creed of the Protector**: The Sentinel is dedicated to protecting others at all costs. They gain powerful defensive technology and energy shields to safeguard allies.
2. **Creed of the Hunter**: The Sentinel is a relentless pursuer of dangerous threats. Their tech allows for enhanced tracking, targeting systems, and mobility upgrades.
3. **Creed of the Enforcer**: The Sentinel ensures the law or their creed is followed. They are equipped with pacification technology, crowd control gear, and non-lethal methods for detaining enemies.

### **Abilities and Features**:

**Tech Invocations (Replaces Paladin Spells)**: Instead of casting spells, the Sentinel uses their advanced gear and technology to achieve similar effects. These invocations are either gadgets, energy fields, or tactical abilities that mimic Paladin spells. Here are examples:

- **Energy Barrier** (Replaces _Shield of Faith_): The Sentinel deploys a temporary energy barrier around themselves or an ally, increasing their defences.
- **Pulse Blast** (Replaces _Smite_): The Sentinel channels their energy weapon or melee weapon to deliver a pulse blast of kinetic force, dealing extra energy damage.
- **Nano-Healing** (Replaces _Lay on Hands_): The Sentinel injects nanobots into an ally, rapidly healing wounds and restoring health.
- **Stasis Field** (Replaces _Hold Person_): The Sentinel traps a target in a localized stasis field, freezing them in place.

---

### **Exosuit Abilities (Replaces Auras)**:

The Sentinel’s high-tech exosuit emits powerful energy fields that affect those around them. These “auras” can have a range of effects depending on the Sentinel's creed:

- **Shielding Aura**: Allies within 10 feet gain temporary hit points at the start of their turn.
- **Hunting Aura**: Enemies within 10 feet have disadvantage on attempts to hide from the Sentinel or escape detection.
- **Enforcement Aura**: Enemies within 10 feet are slowed, reducing their speed by half.

---

### **Code of Honor (Replaces Oath Features)**:

The Sentinel gains unique abilities based on their chosen creed. These abilities manifest as tech-enhanced physical or battlefield skills:

- **Creed of the Protector**:
    
    - _Guardian Protocol_: As a reaction, the Sentinel can swap places with an ally to take an attack meant for them.
    - _Fortress Mode_: The Sentinel's exosuit expands into a heavily armored defensive stance, reducing incoming damage by half for 1 minute.
- **Creed of the Hunter**:
    
    - _Lock-On_: The Sentinel gains a +2 to hit a marked target, and critical hits occur on a 19-20.
    - _Boosted Mobility_: The exosuit’s thrusters allow for enhanced movement, granting the Sentinel the ability to dash as a bonus action and ignore difficult terrain.
- **Creed of the Enforcer**:
    
    - _Pacification Field_: The Sentinel emits a field that pacifies all enemies in a 30-foot radius, causing them to drop their weapons for 1 minute unless they succeed on a saving throw.
    - _Disarmament Protocol_: Once per short rest, the Sentinel can disable all enemy weapons within 20 feet for 1 round.

### **Advanced Tech Weapons (Replaces Divine Smite)**:

The Sentinel’s primary combat power lies in their advanced weapon systems. When they strike with a melee or ranged weapon, they can channel their suit’s energy for devastating effects:

- **Energy Surge**: The Sentinel releases a massive burst of energy through their weapon, dealing extra energy damage on a successful hit. (1D6)
- **Overclocked Strike**: Once per long rest, the Sentinel can supercharge their weapon for one devastating attack, dealing double damage and stunning the target.

---

### **Nano-Healing Module (Replaces Lay on Hands)**:

The Sentinel has a built-in nano-healing module in their suit. They can heal themselves or others by injecting nanobots into wounds. The pool of healing points recharges after a long rest.

---

### **Defensive Overload (Replaces Divine Shielding Abilities)**:

At higher levels, the Sentinel can overload their exosuit’s defenses, creating powerful protective effects for themselves and allies. These defenses last for a limited time but offer great protection:

- **Overload Barrier**: The Sentinel’s suit generates a massive energy shield that grants them resistance to all damage for 1 minute.
- **EMP Pulse**: The Sentinel releases an EMP pulse, disabling nearby enemy weapons and technology for a few rounds.

---

### **Exo Mastery (Replaces Paladin’s Level 20 Abilities)**:

At the pinnacle of their power, the Sentinel can fully integrate with their exosuit, becoming a walking tank on the battlefield. They gain enhanced stats, speed, and resilience, or additional combat and support capabilities depending on their chosen creed.![[DALL·E 2024-10-20 22.20.46 - An action shot of a futuristic Sentinel, a replacement for the Paladin class, using advanced technology in a sci-fi themed campaign.
