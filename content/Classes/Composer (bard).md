Certainly! Here’s a reimagined **Bard** class for your sci-fi campaign, focused on technology, sound, and digital influence:

---

### **Composer  (Bard Replacement)**

**Role**: The Composer  is a master of manipulating digital systems, soundwaves, and frequencies, using technology to inspire, control, and deceive. Instead of traditional magic, the Composer  wields advanced sound tech and hacking tools to support allies, debilitate foes, and control the battlefield.

---

### **Key Attributes**:

- *Charisma* (primary): For leading and inspiring both people and machines.
- *Intelligence* (secondary): For mastering technology, hacking, and systems.
- *Dexterity* (optional): For fast actions and adaptability in battle.

### **Composer  Features**:

**Sonic Amplification (Replaces Bardic Inspiration)**:  
The Composer  uses advanced sound manipulation to enhance allies’ abilities. As a bonus action, the Composer  can grant an ally within 60 feet a **Sonic Amplification die** (a d6, increasing as the Composer  levels up). The ally can add this die to an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Alternatively, the ally can use the die to amplify an attack, causing extra sonic damage.

**Harmonic Shielding (Replaces Song of Rest)**:  
During a short rest, the Composer  can create a harmonic frequency that resonates through their team’s gear. This shielding grants temporary hit points to allies who spend Hit Dice to heal during a short rest, providing additional protection as they recover.

---

### **Soundwave Control**:
Instead of spells, Composer s utilize **soundwaves**, **hacking**, and **data manipulation** to produce effects similar to traditional magic.

**Soundwave Manipulation**:  
Composer s use **soundwave-based technology** to create offensive and defensive effects, similar to spells:

- **Disruptive Pulse** (Replaces Vicious Mockery): Fires a pulse of sonic energy that deals 1d6 sonic damage and causes the target to suffer disadvantage on their next attack roll.
- **Resonance Field** (Replaces Cure Wounds): The Composer  uses harmonic frequencies to mend wounds, healing an ally within touch range for 1d8 + Charisma modifier.
- **Frequency Distortion** (Replaces Invisibility): The Composer  emits a frequency that distorts light, turning them or an ally invisible for a limited time.
- **Sonic Blast** (Replaces Thunderwave): The Composer  releases a concussive blast of sound, damaging enemies and pushing them back.

**Data Hacking**:  
Composer s have the ability to **hack** enemy systems, manipulating the battlefield by taking control of technology.

- **Overload Circuit** (Replaces Heat Metal): The Composer  can overload a piece of machinery or an enemy’s weapon, causing it to malfunction, heat up, or disable temporarily.
- **Hijack System** (Replaces Hold Person): The Composer  can hack into an enemy's cybernetic systems or drones, paralyzing them for a short duration.
- **Glitch Field** (Replaces Mirror Image): The Composer  creates holographic duplicates of themselves by projecting glitching data around them, confusing enemies.

### **Sub-Classes (Replaces Bardic Colleges)**:

At level 3, the Composer  chooses a **Tech Discipline**, which grants them specialized abilities.

1. **Discipline of the Soundweaver**:  
   Masters of using sound as both weapon and shield, Soundweavers specialize in sonic attacks and defenses.

   - *Sonic Barrage*: The Composer  can unleash a powerful barrage of sound that hits multiple enemies, dealing sonic damage in a cone.
   - *Echo Shield*: The Composer  generates a soundwave shield that deflects projectiles and weakens energy attacks.

2. **Discipline of the Codebreaker**:  
   Codebreakers are expert hackers, able to take control of technology, drones, and systems.

   - *System Hijack*: The Composer  can take control of enemy machines or drones, turning them against their original owner.
   - *Data Surge*: Once per long rest, the Composer  can hack into an enemy’s systems, stealing information and using it to predict enemy actions, granting advantage on attack rolls against them for 1 minute.

3. **Discipline of the Performer**:  
   These Composer s use sound to manipulate and control crowds or enemies, focusing on control and deception.

   - *Harmonic Manipulation*: The Composer  can amplify their voice to charm or intimidate enemies, influencing their emotions or convincing them to follow commands.
   - *Disruption Matrix*: The Composer  can create a field of noise that disrupts enemy communications or attacks, imposing disadvantage on attack rolls for enemies within range.

### **Advanced Tech Abilities (Replaces Magical Secrets)**:
At certain levels, the Composer  gains the ability to combine their technology with skills from other disciplines, allowing them to choose **two advanced tech abilities** from any class. This could include creating defensive barriers (similar to magic shields), calling down orbital strikes (replacing fireball), or installing temporary energy shields on their allies.

---

### **Soundwave Mastery (Replaces Countercharm)**:
As a master of sound and frequency, the Composer  can use their abilities to resist mind control and panic effects. By emitting a soundwave frequency, they grant allies advantage on saving throws against being frightened, charmed, or stunned.

---

### **Master of Frequencies (Level 20 Ability)**:
At the pinnacle of their power, the Composer  gains ultimate control over frequencies, soundwaves, and digital systems. Once per long rest, they can **Dominate the Network**, granting them the ability to:

- Control any piece of technology in the environment for 1 minute, turning it to their advantage.
- Emit a **Resonance Pulse**, dealing massive sonic damage to all enemies within a 60-foot radius and healing all allies for half the damage dealt.
- Create a **Harmonic Field** that grants all allies within 30 feet resistance to all damage for 1 minute.

---

### **Composer  Tactics**:
The Composer  excels in both offensive and defensive support roles, able to manipulate sound and technology to bend the battlefield to their will. They can disrupt enemy tactics, boost their allies' performance, and use digital tools to gain the upper hand. With their specialized tech, they remain highly versatile, adaptable, and strategic in every encounter.
