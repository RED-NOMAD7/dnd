### **Cyber Berserker (Barbarian Replacement)**

**Role**: The Cyber Berserker is a warrior enhanced by cybernetic implants, exoskeletal technology, and bio-mechanical augmentations. Fueled by rage and advanced tech, they become an unstoppable force, capable of smashing through enemies with sheer physical power and high-tech weaponry. They can shrug off damage, destroy foes with brutal strikes, and use their cybernetics to boost their combat abilities beyond human limits.

---

### **Key Attributes**:

- *Strength* (primary): For powerful melee attacks.
- *Constitution* (secondary): For durability and staying power.
- *Dexterity*: Useful for combat reflexes and mobility when using lighter gear.

### **Cyber Berserker Features**:

**Rage (Reimagined)**:  
The Cyber Berserker enters a **rage mode** by activating their cybernetic implants, boosting their physical strength, reaction time, and damage resistance. While in rage mode, they gain extra damage on melee attacks and resistance to kinetic and energy damage.

- **Rage Mode Boost**: While raging, the Cyber Berserker deals additional damage (starting at +2) and gains resistance to all kinetic (physical) damage and energy-based attacks. Rage Mode lasts for 1 minute.

---

**Cybernetic Enhancements (Replaces Unarmored Defense)**:  
Instead of relying on natural toughness, the Cyber Berserker is equipped with **cybernetic augmentations** that enhance their combat abilities. These enhancements provide increased durability, speed, and reflexes.

- **Armored Exoskeleton**: The Cyber Berserker’s implants or exosuit increase their AC based on their Constitution modifier, reflecting the strength and durability of their enhanced body.
- **Adrenaline Surge**: When the Berserker takes damage, their cybernetic implants automatically trigger an **adrenaline surge**, increasing their AC by +2 until the end of their next turn.

**Combat Modes**:

The Cyber Berserker can choose a **Combat Mode** that defines their fighting style, focusing on brutal melee attacks, close-range energy weapons, or even massive exo-powered strikes.

1. **Brawler Mode**: Specializes in unarmed combat, melee weapons, and close-quarters brutality.
   - *Crushing Fist*: The Berserker’s unarmed strikes deal 1d8 damage, and they can grapple or shove enemies with advantage.
   - *Exo-Powered Slam*: Once per short rest, the Berserker can slam the ground with their enhanced strength, dealing area damage (2d8) and knocking enemies prone.

2. **Heavy Assault Mode**: Focuses on wielding heavy weapons, from massive energy hammers to advanced two-handed plasma blades.
   - *Wield Massive Weapons*: The Berserker can wield oversized weapons, increasing their damage dice by 1 step (e.g., 1d12 becomes 2d6).
   - *Juggernaut Charge*: The Berserker can charge forward and make a devastating melee attack, dealing extra damage and pushing enemies back.

3. **Shock Trooper Mode**: Combines melee combat with close-range energy weapons, perfect for taking out multiple enemies at once.
   - *Pulse Blades*: The Berserker equips pulse blades or shock gauntlets, which deal both kinetic and energy damage, allowing them to bypass enemy defenses.
   - *Shockwave Strike*: Once per short rest, the Berserker can release a shockwave from their weapons, dealing AoE damage (3d6) to nearby enemies.

### **Nano-Healing Boost (Replaces Fast Movement)**:  
The Cyber Berserker’s nanotech implants constantly monitor and repair their body. When they move, they gain a **nano-healing boost**, which heals minor wounds or increases their overall health.

- **Nano-Healing**: While raging and moving at least 20 feet per turn, the Berserker regains hit points equal to 1d6 per turn, reflecting their body’s ability to heal minor wounds during combat.

---

### **Cyber Resilience (Replaces Reckless Attack and Danger Sense)**:  
The Cyber Berserker’s implants provide enhanced reflexes, danger awareness, and damage resistance. They can push their systems beyond normal limits, shrugging off damage and reacting faster than normal.

- **Reinforced Systems**: Once per short rest, the Berserker can activate their **reinforced systems**, gaining temporary hit points equal to their level and resistance to all damage for 1 round.
- **Reaction Boost**: While raging, the Berserker can use their reaction to make an attack of opportunity or counterattack when an enemy hits them.

### **Upgraded Cybernetics (Replaces Primal Path)**:

At level 3, the Cyber Berserker chooses an **Upgraded Cybernetic Path**, enhancing their body with specialized systems.

1. **Path of the Colossus**:  
   This path focuses on raw power, turning the Berserker into a near-indestructible juggernaut.

   - *Titan Strength*: The Berserker gains advantage on all Strength checks and saving throws while raging. They can also lift or break heavy objects without difficulty.
   - *Colossus Armor*: The Berserker’s exosuit provides additional plating, granting +1 AC and resistance to fire or cold damage.

2. **Path of the Storm**:  
   This path focuses on mobility and destructive energy, using implants to generate powerful electrical fields or manipulate the battlefield.

   - *Storm Aura*: While raging, the Berserker generates an electrical aura that deals 1d6 energy damage to all enemies within 10 feet at the start of their turn.
   - *Lightning Dash*: Once per short rest, the Berserker can move up to 60 feet in a straight line, dealing 2d6 electrical damage to all enemies in their path.

3. **Path of the Berserker**:  
   This path emphasizes brutal, relentless combat, with cybernetic implants enhancing their ability to deal and endure damage.

   - *Adrenaline Overdrive*: The Berserker can push their body beyond normal limits, gaining an additional attack per round while raging, but takes 1d6 damage at the end of each turn.
   - *Endless Fury*: When reduced to 0 hit points, the Berserker can continue fighting for 1 additional round, gaining temporary hit points equal to half their maximum hit points.

### **Unstoppable (Replaces Persistent Rage and Relentless Rage)**:  
At higher levels, the Cyber Berserker becomes an unstoppable force, capable of surviving extreme damage and continuing to fight no matter what.

- **System Reboot**: When reduced to 0 hit points, the Berserker can reboot their cybernetics, regaining 50 hit points. This can only be used once per long rest.
- **Indestructible**: While raging, the Berserker cannot be knocked unconscious or killed outright, and they automatically stabilize when reduced to 0 hit points.

### **Overclocked Fury (Level 20 Ability)**:
At their peak, the Cyber Berserker gains the ability to **overclock** their systems, boosting their combat abilities to inhuman levels for a short period.

- **Overclocked Rage**: Once per long rest, the Berserker can enter **Overclocked Rage**. For 1 minute, they gain the following benefits:
  - Their movement speed is doubled.
  - They gain advantage on all attack rolls and saving throws.
  - They deal an additional 3d6 damage on every attack.
  - They gain resistance to all damage types.

### **Cyber Berserker Tactics**:
The Cyber Berserker is a terrifying force of destruction, charging into battle with enhanced physical abilities and cybernetic implants that keep them in the fight. Their ability to shrug off damage, crush enemies with raw power, and heal themselves mid-battle makes them an unstoppable force in close combat. Whether wielding massive weapons or punching through enemy lines with augmented fists, the Cyber Berserker is the ultimate warrior on the futuristic battlefield.
