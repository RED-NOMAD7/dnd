**Key Abilities**:

- _Intelligence_ (primary) for controlling and programming the nanites.
- _Charisma_ (secondary) for establishing a pact with a powerful entity or AI that grants the player access to this technology.

**Nanopacts**:

- The Nanoweaver’s power stems from a _pact_ with an ancient sentient machine intelligence, allowing access to vast reserves of nanobots. These "nanopacts" shape how they interact with nanotechnology, providing unique boons and abilities.

**Example Nanopacts**:

1. **Pact of the Architect**: The Nanoweaver can reshape materials and objects using their nanites, allowing them to create or destroy structures on a molecular level.
2. **Pact of the Overseer**: The Nanoweaver can control the battlefield by deploying surveillance drones that give them heightened awareness and grant tactical advantages to their allies.

### **Abilities and Features**:

**Nanobot Invocation** (Replaces Eldritch Invocations):  
At different levels, the Nanoweaver gains invocations—enhancements that change the way they use nanites. For example:

- **Nanite Shielding**: Create a field of nanites that boosts AC or provides temporary hit points to the Nanoweaver or an ally.
- **Nano-Blast**: Fire a concentrated blast of nanobots at a target, dealing kinetic or energy damage.
- **Swarm of Disruption**: Release a swarm of nanobots that target and disable an enemy’s technology (disabling electronics, weapons, etc.).

### **Nanite Spells** (Replaces Spellcasting):

Nanoweavers still cast spells, but now they're reimagined as nanotech manipulations. Here are examples of spell replacements:

- **Eldritch Blast** → **Nanite Barrage**: A beam of nanites that disrupts targets on a molecular level.
- **Hex** → **Nano-Virus**: The Nanoweaver infects a target with a hostile program that weakens their abilities.
- **Invisibility** → **Nanite Cloak**: Nanites refract light, turning the Nanoweaver invisible.
- **Mirror Image** → **Nanite Projections**: The Nanoweaver creates holographic duplicates using nanobots.

### **Patron-Specific Powers** (Replaces Patron Abilities):

Each Nanopact grants specific abilities, aligning with the type of intelligence the Nanoweaver is connected to.

- **Pact of the Architect**: Can reshape or build objects using nanites (similar to _Mold Earth_ or _Fabricate_).
- **Pact of the Overseer**: Grants superior tactical control with surveillance nanites, increasing perception and insight, or giving the ability to map enemy movements.

### **Nanite Swarm (Signature Ability)**:

At higher levels, the Nanoweaver can unleash a massive **Nanite Swarm**, which behaves similarly to an area-of-effect spell. This swarm could devour, build, or sabotage anything in its radius. For instance:

- **Disintegration Swarm**: Nanites swarm a targeted area, consuming everything within.
- **Restoration Swarm**: Nanites heal allies or repair machinery in a target area.

### **Eldritch Master (Nanite Overlord)**:

At the highest levels, the Nanoweaver can fully synchronize with their nanobots, becoming a near-unstoppable force. They can control vast swarms, manipulate entire sections of the battlefield, or dominate entire armies of machines with their mastery.![[DALL·E 2024-10-20 22.38.02 - An action shot of a futuristic Warlock using nanotechnology as a replacement for magic in a sci-fi themed campaign.
