### **Hunter-Scout Features**:

**Tech Mastery (Replaces Spellcasting)**:  
Instead of traditional spells, the Hunter-Scout uses **tech gadgets**, **drones**, and **advanced weaponry** to achieve similar effects. These gadgets allow them to manipulate the environment, track enemies, or enhance their combat abilities. At certain levels, the Hunter-Scout can choose from a selection of tech-based abilities:

- **Tactical Drone** (Replaces Familiar): The Hunter-Scout can deploy a drone to scout ahead, relay information, or assist in combat. The drone can be equipped with a weapon or used to hack systems.

Like traditional Rangers, Hunter-Scouts choose a combat style that determines their approach to combat:

1. **Sniper Specialist**: Focuses on long-range combat, precision, and using high-tech sniper rifles to eliminate enemies from afar.

### **Tracking and Scouting**:

**Enhanced Tracking (Replaces Favored Enemy)**:  
The Hunter-Scout uses advanced scanners and tech tools to track enemies across any terrain. They gain expertise in tracking certain types of enemies, from rogue AI to alien species. The Hunter-Scout’s scanners can detect heat signatures, identify enemy weaknesses, and even hack into enemy communication systems to gather intel.
