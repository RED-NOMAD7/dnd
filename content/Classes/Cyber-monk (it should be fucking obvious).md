### **Cyber-Monk (Monk Replacement)**

**Role**: The Cyber-Monk is a martial artist enhanced by bio-augmentation and advanced energy control. Using their body as a weapon, they harness both physical and internal energy, combining high-tech enhancements with intense discipline. Their agility, reflexes, and manipulation of energy fields allow them to move faster than the eye can see, dodge incoming fire, and strike with deadly precision. 

---

### **Key Attributes**:

- *Dexterity* (primary): For agility, speed, and precision.
- *Wisdom* (secondary): For internal focus, energy control, and awareness.
- *Constitution*: For durability and resisting the effects of physical stress and bio-enhancements.

### **Cyber-Monk Features**:

**Energy Flow (Replaces Ki)**:  
The Cyber-Monk harnesses internal energy (Ki) by syncing with advanced bio-augmentations that enhance their focus and reflexes. This **Energy Flow** allows them to perform extraordinary feats of speed, strength, and defense.

- **Energy Points**: The Cyber-Monk uses **Energy Points** to fuel their abilities, similar to the Monk’s Ki points. These points are used to perform special combat techniques, enhance strikes, and dodge incoming attacks.

**Energy Manipulation Techniques (Replaces Ki Abilities)**:
The Cyber-Monk has access to a variety of **Energy Techniques**, which they can use to control their bio-energy and the energy around them.

- **Energy Strike** (Replaces Flurry of Blows): The Cyber-Monk unleashes a flurry of precise, high-speed strikes that deal additional damage and push back enemies.
- **Phase Shift** (Replaces Step of the Wind): The Cyber-Monk momentarily shifts out of phase with reality, allowing them to move through obstacles, become intangible, or quickly evade attacks.
- **Energy Shield** (Replaces Patient Defense): The Cyber-Monk creates a shield of energy around themselves, increasing their AC and granting advantage on Dexterity saving throws.

### **Combat Styles**:

The Cyber-Monk specializes in different **Combat Styles**, focusing on the type of martial arts or energy manipulation they excel in:

1. **Quantum Strike**: Focuses on fast, high-damage strikes that bypass enemy defenses.
   - *Quantum Punch*: The Cyber-Monk can deliver a punch that ignores armor and deals energy damage in addition to physical damage.
   - *Echo Strike*: When attacking, the Cyber-Monk can create a brief quantum echo, hitting the enemy twice in a single strike.

2. **Energy Manipulator**: Masters of controlling energy fields around them, these Cyber-Monks manipulate their surroundings and opponents.
   - *Energy Wave*: The Cyber-Monk can unleash a shockwave of energy, dealing AoE damage and knocking enemies back.
   - *Energy Pulse*: The Cyber-Monk can redirect incoming energy, absorbing part of the damage and releasing it in a counterattack.

3. **Shadow Assassin**: Combines stealth, agility, and speed, allowing the Cyber-Monk to strike from the shadows and disappear.
   - *Cloak Field*: The Cyber-Monk can activate an invisibility cloak for a short period, allowing them to disappear from sight and strike undetected.

### **Cybernetic Enhancements (Replaces Unarmored Movement and Defense)**:

The Cyber-Monk’s augmentations grant them superior speed, reflexes, and durability.

- **Augmented Reflexes**: The Cyber-Monk’s speed increases as they level up, allowing them to move at superhuman speeds and dodge attacks with ease. They can move along walls, ceilings, or perform gravity-defying leaps using enhanced exoskeletons or boosters.
- **Energy Armor**: Instead of relying on armor, the Cyber-Monk’s augmentations create a natural energy shield that increases their AC as they level up, making them difficult to hit.

### **Channel Bio-Energy (Replaces Martial Arts)**:

The Cyber-Monk’s strikes are not just physical; they channel bio-energy into each attack, allowing them to deal devastating blows.

- **Energy Infused Strikes**: The Cyber-Monk’s unarmed strikes deal both kinetic and energy damage, bypassing traditional armor and harming energy-based creatures or constructs.
- **Energy Overload**: The Cyber-Monk can temporarily overcharge their augmentations, dealing additional energy damage on all attacks for a short time (similar to the traditional Monk’s extra attack feature).

### **Tech Mastery (Replaces Monastic Traditions)**:

At level 3, the Cyber-Monk chooses a **Tech Mastery**, focusing on specific technologies or augmentations to enhance their combat prowess.

1. **Path of the Energy Blade**  
   This path focuses on wielding energy-based melee weapons, such as plasma blades or energy gauntlets, for close-combat mastery.

   - *Energy Blade Mastery*: The Cyber-Monk gains proficiency with energy melee weapons, increasing their damage output and versatility in combat.
   - *Energy Blade Flurry*: The Cyber-Monk can make an extra attack with their energy blade when using the Energy Strike technique.

2. **Path of the Nano-Monk**  
   The Nano-Monk integrates nanotechnology into their augmentations, allowing them to heal quickly, enhance their attacks, or alter their body on a molecular level.

   - *Nanite Healing*: The Cyber-Monk can use nanites to heal themselves over time, recovering hit points at the start of their turn for 1 minute.
   - *Nanite Boost*: The Cyber-Monk can temporarily enhance their strength, dexterity, or speed for 1 minute, gaining advantage on related checks.

3. **Path of the Quantum Monk**  
   Quantum Monks master the manipulation of time and space, using their augmentations to teleport, phase through objects, and move faster than the eye can see.

   - *Quantum Leap*: The Cyber-Monk can teleport up to 30 feet as a bonus action, bypassing physical barriers.
   - *Time Dilation*: The Cyber-Monk can slow time for a brief moment, allowing them to make an additional attack or dodge incoming attacks.

### **Enhanced Focus (Replaces Deflect Missiles and Stunning Strike)**:

The Cyber-Monk’s augmentations allow them to enhance their focus, deflect energy-based projectiles, and stun enemies by disrupting their energy fields.

- **Energy Deflection**: The Cyber-Monk can deflect energy blasts, lasers, or projectiles aimed at them, reducing or negating the damage.
- **Energy Disruption**: By striking an enemy’s core, the Cyber-Monk can disrupt their energy flow, stunning them for a short time if they fail a saving throw.

---

### **Cyber Mastery (Level 20 Ability)**:

At the pinnacle of their power, the Cyber-Monk gains **Cyber Mastery**, granting them ultimate control over their augmentations and energy manipulation.

- **Cyber Ascendant**: The Cyber-Monk can enter a heightened state of focus for 1 minute, gaining the following benefits:
  - They gain advantage on all attacks and saving throws.
  - Their movement speed is doubled.
  - They gain resistance to all damage types for the duration.

### **Cyber-Monk Tactics**:
The Cyber-Monk is a master of agility, energy manipulation, and martial prowess. They thrive in fast-paced combat, using their enhanced speed and reflexes to outmanoeuvre enemies while delivering powerful strikes. Whether phasing through walls, deflecting projectiles, or teleporting across the battlefield, the Cyber-Monk is a force of nature, blending technology and ancient discipline.
